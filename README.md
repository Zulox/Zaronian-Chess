#Zaronian Chess
This is a game of chess, however this is not like the traditional chess we all familiar with.

it is a chess with a twist included	


#How To Play
The Plus can move vertically or horizontally, up to 2 steps in any direction in a straight line.

The Triangle can move diagonally, both up and down, up to 2 steps in any direction in a straight line.

The Chevron must move in an L shape, exactly two steps then 1 step right or left. (This is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.)

The Sun can move only 1 step in any direction. The game ends when the sun is captured by the other side.


After 3 turns, a Plus will turn into a Triangle, a Triangle will turn into a Chevron, and a Chevron will turn into a Plus. 

(This makes Zaronian chess different from all other chess games, because the pieces will transform like that.)
